Cloud Foundry: Getting Started
===========================
VMware Cloud Foundry for Eclipse and STS
--------------------
For those developing in Java, Cloud Foundry provides a plug-in that works with the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and SpringSource Tool Suite (STS). This describes how to install the plug-in and how to deploy an application using Eclipse or STS.

##Prerequisites

If you don't already have STS or Eclipse installed, do so now:

+	[Eclipse download](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

	>Confirm that you have Eclipse IDE for JEE Developers so that all known dependencies are satisfied.
	
+	[SpringSource Tool suite download](http://www.springsource.com/downloads/sts)

	>For STS you will want to have an install version of 2.6.1 or higher.
	
##Installation

###STS Extension Install

After you confirm the installed STS, open the tool and follow these steps:

1.	Select Help > Dashboard.

	>The Dashboard will open.

2.	Click on the Extensions Tab.

	>A list of extensions will load and display.

3.	Select Cloud Foundry Integration under the Server and Clouds category.

###Eclipse Marketplace Install

In Eclipse, do the following:

1.	Select Help > Eclipse Marketplace.

	>A panel opens showing different plug-ins and add-ons.
	
2.	Enter 'cloud foundry' under Find.
	
		![eclipse install](assets/images/screenshots/eclipse_mkt.jpg "eclipse install")
		
3.	In the search results select Cloud Foundry Integration.

3.	Click Install
	
	>An install wizard appears where you follow the steps provided.

4.	After the finish installing, restart Eclipse.

	>You are ready to connect to Cloud Foundry's cloud.
	


##Deploying Applications

The plug-in integrates STS and Eclipse via Web Tools Project (WTP) Server infrastructure, which is commonly used to deploy Java web applications to remote servers.

###Connecting to Cloud Foundry

In Eclipse or STS you start by creating a new server. This server represents your Cloud Foundry account and you can connect to Cloud Foundry with it:


1.	Select Window > Show view... > Other... > Servers.  
	
	![deploy via sts](assets/images/screenshots/sts_deploy.jpg "deploy via sts")
		
2.	Right click in the Servers view and select New > Server.

	>A wizard will open where you set up the server.
	
3.	Under the VMware category, select Cloud Foundry.

	![sts cf new server](assets/images/screenshots/sts_cf_server.jpg "sts cf new server")

4.	Click Next

5.	Enter your username/email and password you received from Cloud Foundry:


![sts cf new server credentials](assets/images/screenshots/sts_cf_cred.jpg "sts cf new server credentials")


6.	Select the cloud you want to connect to.

	>If you want to connect to your Cloud Foundry cloud, under URL choose VMware Cloud Foundry â€“ http://api.cloudfoundry.com
	>*Note you could also choose a local installation of Cloud Foundry at this point.*
7.	Click Validate Account to test the connection.

	![connect via wtp](assets/images/screenshots/sts_new_server.jpg "connecting via WTP")

8.	Click Finish.

	>The plug-in establishes the connection to Cloud Foundry. You can see your deployed applications under Cloud Foundry server node in the Servers view.
	



###Adding and Starting Applications

1.	Add the Application. To add it to your cloud you can either:

	+	Drag and drop the application's listing in your IDE onto the Cloud Foundry server in the Servers panel, or
	+	In the Servers panel, open that servers context menu by right-clicking and select Add and Remove...
	
2.	Start the Application. Right click the application in the Servers panel and select Start.

	>A wizard appears where you can provide the application name, select a URL and allocate memory to the application.
	
3. Click Finish. The plug-in uploads and starts your application on the cloud.

4. Checking Status. Double-click the application in the Servers panel.

	>The Server Editor appears and displays information specific to your application on the cloud.
	
###Provisioning Services

To provision services which will in turn be available to your application:

1.	In the Servers panel, double click on any application name.

	>STS activates the Package Explorer tab as navigation and then the Applications tab in the workspace. 
	
	>The Applications tab lists all the applications plus details about the selected application.

2.	In the Services Section, click Add service.

	![sts add service](assets/images/screenshots/sts_new_svc.jpg "sts add service")

3.	Provide a name for the new service.

4.	Select the service type (MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, RabbitMQ)

	![sts create service](assets/images/screenshots/sts_create_svcs.jpg "sts create service")

The plug-in request the service from Cloud Foundry and it appears in the Services section under the Applications tab.	

###Binding Services to Your App

To provision and bind services to your application:

1.	Stop your application:

	+	In the Server panel, right-click on the application name then select Stop, or
	
	+	In the Applications panel, select the application and click Stop

2.	In the Applications panel, select the application you want to add a service to.

3.	Drag and drop a listed service to the Application Services table

	![sts bind service](assets/images/screenshots/sts_bind_svc.jpg "sts bind service")

5.	Click Restart.

###Remote File Access

To access files from your application that are remote:

1.	Open Server Editor.

2.	Under the Application Details pane, click Remote Systems View.

	![sts remote files](assets/images/screenshots/sts_remote_sys.jpg "sts remote files")

	>The Remote Systems tab appears below the workspace displaying remote resources.

3.	Browse the file tree and open files.
